# Credits and thanks

## Didn't do this

Thanks to [Florient Chouteau](florient.f.chouteau@airbus.com>) and Dennis Wilson 

for their work on this subject.

I took most of the content [from theirs](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/OBD/1_1_overview.html).

## Cloud Definition

> The cloud is a real physical place - accessed over the internet - where a service is performed for you or where your stuff is stored. Your stuff is stoed in the cloud, not on your device because the cloud is not on any device; the cloud lives in datacenters. A program running on your device accesses the cloud over the internet. The cloud is infinite, accessible from anywhere, at any time

Todd Hoff in "Explain the Cloud like I'm 10"

## Cloud Computing

Using cloud resources for any purpose, web server, storage, computations.

- The cloud is a set of **cloud providers**
- Renting cloud **services**
- Increasingly **abstracted** from the physical hardware

. . .

Examples:

- "Renting a server" ... (this is pure "cloud computing")
- "Replicated & Secure storage space"
- "Autoscaling deployment of a microservice"

## A portion of AWS services

## How?

# Virtualization

## Definition

> In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.

Wikipedia

> Basically we are running software on "abstract hardware" which is a "portion" of a real computer ("bare metal")

## Desktop virtualization

## Server virtualization

## Virtualization evolution

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/10698/1*wE7TrQmFyRTDwh6VpbkbMQ.png)

## Definitions

- Hypervisor (VMWare, Virtualbox, KVM): A hypervisor is a program for creating and running virtual machines
- Virtual Machine: A virtual machine is the emulated equivalent of a computer system that runs on top of another system
- Containers: Isolated environments that share the same underlying OS (more this afternoon) & resources

### Hardware abstraction

- Hardware Abstraction ("download more RAM")
- Fine-grained resource allocation / sharing
- Decouple maintenance of hardware from maintenance of software

### Reliability, security...

# Cloud history

## AWS

Once upon a time...

Amazon (the e-commerce store) has "scaling" issues

![](https://cdn.chiefmartec.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/jeff_bezos_big_mandate.jpg)

## Idea

2002-2003; The idea

> Building an infrastructure that is completely standardized, completely automated, and relied extensively on web services for things like storage 

http://blog.b3k.us/2009/01/25/ec2-origins.html

## So ...

So basically Amazon became very good at *running* scalable infrastructure as *services*

- For themselves...
- ... but also for other partners (target)

And that infrastructure is often there to answer peak load...

## Let's sell it !

## Different layers of abstractions

## Abstraction examples

- Using data storage service like google cloud storage without managing the infrastructure
- Using google drive
- Renting a server with hard drive and storing data

. . . 

- Using data storage service like google cloud storage without managing the infrastructure **PaaS**
- Using google drive **SaaS**
- Renting a server with hard drive and storing data **IaaS**

# Old slides

## Different approaches

IaaS, PaaS, CaaS, SaaS, Object Storage

## Economical models, Pay as you go

## Technical benefits

Infrastructure as Code, Continuous Deployment, Infinite resources, scalability

## Cloud engines
Google, AWS, OVH, Openstack

# New Data processing standard

## Object store vs posix file system

## Compute as a service

Using K8S or not.

# First interaction with Google Cloud

## TP Google Cloud

Everyone has its credits?

how to get a server? 

TP through Google console, account, princing, ressourcesâ€¦ VMs and Kubernetes
