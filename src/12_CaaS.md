# Credits and thanks

## Didn't do this

Thanks to [Florient Chouteau](florient.f.chouteau@airbus.com>) and Dennis Wilson 

for their work on this subject.

I took most of the content from theirs:
- https://supaerodatascience.github.io/OBD/slides/1_4_containers.html

# Containers

## Why containers?

- How to get software to run reliably when moved from one computing environment to another
  - from a developer's laptop to a test environment
  - from staging to prod
- Packaging application + runtime as a syngle package
- Abstract differences in OS and underlying hardware
- Build once, run anywhere
- Pet vs Cattle, at another level

## Container vs VM

![](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt300387d93dabf50e/bltb6200bc085503718/5e1f209a63d1b6503160c6d5/containers-vs-virtual-machines.jpg)

## Container vs VM: similarities and drawbacks

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}

### Similarities

* Isolated environments for applications
* Movable between hosts

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

## VM Drawbacks

* VM Contains full OS at each install => Install + Resource overhead
* VM needs pre-allocation of resource for each VM (=> Waste if not used)
* Communication between VM <=> Communication between computers

:::
::: {.column width="30%"}

## Continers Drawbacks

* Containers are Linux based (but still works on Windows)
* Isolation is not perfect since containers share underlying kernels 
  * (security and stability)

## Applications concept

![Build, Ship, Run](https://www.nebulaworks.com/insights/posts/containers-the-new-guy-on-the-block-so-why-all-the-noise/assets/images/build-ship-run.77855d42ceb65e4f433e274a3105b95d.gif)

## Containers for Data science

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Data Science is about **reproducibility**

* Experimental science
* Communicating results
* Hands-out to other teams
* Deployment and versioning of models

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

So... containers ?

* ... for deployment
* ... for standardized development environments
* ... dependency management
* ... for complex / large scale workflows

# Docker

## Docker

Docker is **a** solution that **standardizes** packaging and execution of software in isolated
 environments
 (**containers**) that share resources and can communicate between themselves

> Build, Share, and Run Any App, Anywhere

## History

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

* Created in 2013
* Open Source (some parts)
* Not a new idea but set a new standard
* Docker is a company built around its main product (Docker Engine)
* In charge of dev of everything docker + additional paid services (Docker hub...)

## Under the hood

Docker is some fancy tech over linux kernel capabilities (containers)

## Using Docker in practice

![](static/img/docker-jworkflow.jpg)

## Vocabulary of Docker

* **Layer**: Set of read-only files to provision the system
* **Image**: Read-Only layer "snapshot" (or blueprint) of an environment. Can inherit from another **Image**. Image have a *name* and a *tag*
* **Container**: Read-Write instance of an **Image**
* **DockerFile**: Description of the process used to build an Image
* **Container Registry**: Repository of Docker Images
* **Dockerhub**: The main container registry of docker.com

## Workflow

![workflow](https://pointful.github.io/docker-intro/docker-img/basics-of-docker-system.png)

## Layers, Container, Image

![layers](https://jfrog--c.documentforce.com/servlet/servlet.ImageServer?id=0151r000006uDeN&oid=00D20000000M3v0&lastMod=1584629516000)

## Layer / Image Analogy

Docker:
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.6
RUN pip install torch
CMD ipython
```

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t my-image:1.0 .
docker run my-image
```

Python:
```python
class BaseImage:
    def __init__(self, a):
       self.a = a

class NewImage(BaseImage):
    def __init__(self, a, b):
       super(NewImage, self).__init__(a=a)
       self.b = b

container = NewImage(a=0,b=1)
```

## Dockerfile

* Used to build Images

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7
ENV MYVAR="HELLO"
RUN pip install torch
COPY my-conf.txt /app/my-conf.txt
ADD my-file.txt /app/my-file.txt
EXPOSE 9000
WORKDIR "/WORKDIR"
USER MYUSER
ENTRYPOINT ["/BIN/BASH"]
CMD ["ECHO‚Äù , "${MYVAR}"]
```

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t my-image:1.0 .
docker run my-image
```

* Reproducible (if you include static data)
* Can be put under version control (simple text file)

## Architecture

![](https://docs.docker.com/engine/images/architecture.svg)

## Registry

* Local registry: All images/containers in your machine
* https://hub.docker.com/
* GCP Container Registry
* Social Dimension (share docker images to speed up development/deployment)

## Alternatives: Singularity

![](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/_static/logo.png)

"Docker for HPC"

- No root daemon process
- Better (?) security
  - Rootless build and run
- Better isolation between users, "just" a process
- Bridge between Dockerimage and Singularity images
- OCI compliant

## Alternatives: Podman

![](https://podman.io/images/podman.svg)

"Rootless Docker for Redhat"

- Not root daemon
- Not need to be root
- Fully compliant with Docker images (and OCI)
- Better security and isolation

# Hands on Docker

## Play with Docker

* You need to have a docker hub account : https://hub.docker.com/
* https://labs.play-with-docker.com/
* Free, interactive, cluster of vms to experiment docker with
* https://training.play-with-docker.com/ lots of resoures !
