# Context

Prerequisite: Dask Hub platform deployed before.

Dataset: New York Taxi cab statistics simplified.

# What has to be done

- What's wrong with pandas?
- Clean big amounts of data using Dask in the cloud (interactive distributed processing)
- Train a machine learning model with a big dataset in input
- Train machine learning models in parallel (hyper parameter search) on smaller input dataset

# Evaluation link

[Let's go](https://github.com/CNES/big-data-processing-course/blob/main/notebooks/EvaluationDaskMLTaxyCabEmpty.ipynb)

- Just git clone this repository from your Juptyerlab to start
- At the end (end periodically) make sure to save your notebook with outputs by downloading it on your laptop
  - You will be noted based on your notebook content
